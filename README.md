# Learning ML — A Playground of Small Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of small, self-contained projects to explore different machine learning algorithms and workflows — learn by doing and have fun along the way.

## What’s inside

- classification — Supervised classification algorithms and comparisons.
- clustering — Unsupervised clustering techniques and visualizations.
- linear_regression — Regression basics and experiments.
- social_filtering — Simple recommenders / collaborative filtering demos.
- titanic_survivors_prediction — An end-to-end, Kaggle-style project (EDA, features, modeling).
- python_fun — Small utilities and exploratory scripts.

Each subproject typically includes Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step EDA, modeling, and evaluation. Some projects write figures or artifacts to exports/ and, where relevant, predictions to submissions/.

## Getting started

- Environment: Use the project’s conda environment (named “condavenv”) with Python 3.12.
- Tools: Jupyter or your favorite IDE/notebook environment (e.g., DataSpell).
- Data: Raw datasets are not committed. If a project needs data, place files in that project’s dataset/ subfolder.

Quick start:
1) Activate the environment.
2) Open the subfolder you’re interested in.
3) Launch and run the notebooks in order (as indicated in each folder).

## Goals

- Explore core ML algorithms in small, focused examples.
- Practice clean experiment structure and simple, reproducible workflows.
- Keep it fun and practical.

## Conventions

- Fixed random seeds where applicable.
- Clear separation of data, notebooks, and outputs inside each subproject.
- Lightweight dependencies; install only what the subproject needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome:
- Keep notebooks concise and well-commented.
- Prefer clear, minimal examples over heavy abstractions.
- Add short READMEs inside subfolders if a project needs special instructions.
